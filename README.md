# Here are three notable features of my project:

- Donations Display: One of the main features of your code is the ability to display a list of donations. The Donations component maps through a donations array and renders individual donation cards using the DonationsCard component. Each donation card includes information like picture, title, category, and more. This feature allows users to view a list of donations available in your application.

- Donation Page: Another significant feature is the DonationPage component. This component displays a grid of donation cards, but it also includes a "See All" button that, when clicked, reveals all available donations. This feature provides users with the option to see more donations, enhancing the user experience.

- Single Donation View: The SingleDonation component allows users to view detailed information about a single donation. It retrieves the donation data based on the id parameter from the URL and displays it in a dedicated view. Users can also donate to the specific donation item by clicking the "Donate" button. This feature provides a detailed view of individual donations and enables users to take specific actions related to a single donation.
